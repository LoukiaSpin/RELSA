Description: The RELSA score and RELSA package comprises a set of functions for assessing relative severity in laboratory
   animals. In animal-based research the problem of severity classification is crucial. As animals cannot communicate their 
   state of well-being, scientists need reliable tools for monitoring severity as closely as possible. It has been shown that 
   a diversity of behavioural tests (and others) may serve this purpose. However, the main issue with these approaches is that
   they are rather specific and difficult to transfer. A comprehensive and easy to use toolbox for the assessment and 
   comparison of different variables and animal models is missing. RELSA offers a first glimpse into this matter by taking 
   a holistic and integrative approach.
